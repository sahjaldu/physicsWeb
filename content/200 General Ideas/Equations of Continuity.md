>A continuity equation or transport equation is an equation that describes the transport of some quantity. It is particularly simple and powerful when applied to a conserved quantity, but it can be generalized to apply to any extensive quantity.

Equations of continuity state that if there are no sources or sinks, then the total mass within a volume element must stay the same.

Equations of continuity can be applied to other scenarios too, such as for conservation of electric charge rather than mass.

For [[Fluid Dynamics|Fluid Flow]], the equations of continuity are:
$$
\rho_{1}A_{1}v_{1}=\rho_{2}A_{2}v_{2}
$$
If the fluid is incompressible: ^6de4cc
$$
A_{1}v_{1}=A_{2}v_{2}
$$
