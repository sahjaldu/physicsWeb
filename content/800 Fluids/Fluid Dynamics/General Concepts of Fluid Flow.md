Some general characteristics of fluid flow:

1. **Fluid flow can be steady or nonsteady.** If variables such as pressure, density, and flow velocity are constant in time throughout the fluid, the flow is steady.Â  If not, it is nonsteady flow. In nonsteady flow, the velocities $\vec{v}$ are functions of time.

2. **Fluid flow can be compressible or incompressible** If density $\rho$ is constant, its flow is incompressible. Liquids are often incompressible, but even for highly compressible gasses changes in density are often insignificant.

3. **Fluid flow can be viscous or nonviscous.** [[Viscosity]] is similar to friction for liquids. [[Kinetic Energy]] with the fluid flow can be transformed into internal energy by viscous forces. The greater the viscosity. the greater the external force needed to maintain flow.

4. **Fluid flow can be rotational or irrotational.** Imagine a leaf carried by the fluid flow. If it is rotated about an axis through its center of mass, it is rotational. Otherwise, it is irrotational.
