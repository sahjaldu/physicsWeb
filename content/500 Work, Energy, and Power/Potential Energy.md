For [[Conservative Force]]s like potential energy, the energy itself represents the state of the *system*, not an individual object. For example, a block high above the earth has a gravitational potential energy related to the block-earth system, and not the block itself. Changes in the system, like the block falling to the ground, represent a change in potential energy, or a [[Work]]:
$$
\Delta U = U_f - U_i = -W=
-\int_{s_i}^{s_f} \vec{F} \cdot d \vec{s}
$$
For a state initial $i$ and a state final $f$ that we define,

We take the inverse to find the force:
$$
\vec{F}(\vec{s})=-\frac{dU(\vec{s})}{dx}
$$

## Conservation of Mechanical Energy

For an isolated system for only conservative forces:
$$
\Delta K_{\mathrm{total}} + \Delta U_{\mathrm{total}} = 0
$$
In other words:
$$
E_{\mathrm{total}}=K_{\mathrm{total}}+U_{\mathrm{total}}
$$
> In an isolated system in which only conservative forces act, the total mechanical energy remains constant.

Using this along with the Work-Energy Theorem, we can use this to analyze conservative systems where we usually used Newton's Laws. In a more applicable form:
$$
K_i + U_i = K_f + U_f
$$
For instances with rotation, we can separate kinetic into and translational and  rotational kinetic energy:
$$
0 = K + K_{\mathrm{rotational}}+ U
$$

> At an equilibrium point of a system we consider that if we place the object (or in general the objects) there with zero Kinetic energy ,the object will stay there . The fact that the object stays there means that it will not change its position , thus **the Potential energy will remain the same** .

Using $\vec{s}(t)$ we can know the future behavior of the particle. We can find $\vec{s}(t)$ using energy:
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{d\vec{s}}{dt} &= v\\
d\vec{s} &= v\ dt\\
\vec{s}(t)&=\int v \ dt \\
\\
\frac{1}{2}mv^2&=E-U(\vec{s})\\
v&=\sqrt{\pm(2/m)[E-U(\vec{s})]}\\
\\
\vec{s}(t)&=\int\sqrt{\pm(2/m)[E-U(\vec{s})]}\ dt
\end{align*}
$$

An important concept to know is [[Static Equilibrium; Elasticity and Fracture|Equillibrium]], a state where when you change the position of the particle the change potential energy remains at zero.
$$
\frac{dU}{d\vec{s}}=0
$$
