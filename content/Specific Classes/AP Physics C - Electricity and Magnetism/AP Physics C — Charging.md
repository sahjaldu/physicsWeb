## Polarization

When a charged object is brought towards a neutral object and the molecules in the neutral object orientate so that there is a net attraction.

This mostly occurs for **insulators**, where there is no major movement of electrons.

## Induction

Induction is similar, but because the neutral object is a conductor, the electrons can freely move. Instead of the molecules orientating, the electrons themselves can move away from the charged object. If there is a ground, then the electrons can move into the ground, leaving the neutral object into a net positively charged object.

>Note that **electrons move** within the object and **protons do not move** within the object.
