Wires and loops can experience net forces as a result of changing [[Magnetic Flux]]. If those forces are unbalanced, they will have a linear acceleration, and if the [[Torque|Torques]] are unbalanced, they will have a rotational acceleration.

This is the principle behind electric motors. A coil [[Rotational Motion|Rotates]] in a [[The Magnetic Field|Magnetic Field]] from a net torque, and the spinning is harnessed for various applications.

For example:

For sides $X$ and $Z$, the force is zero because the current and magnetic field are parallel.

For side $W$ and $Y$, we can use the [[Forces on Moving Charges in Magnetic Fields#^64483d|Right Hand Rule]] to find the force. $W$ has a force going into the page and $Y$ has a force going out of the page.

We now see that the forces cancel ($F_{\mathrm{net}}=0$) but the torques do not. There is a net torque in this situation.

If we shift the angle so that the loop is at a $45^\circ$ angle with $\vec{B}$:

There will still be a net force of zero. However, the net torque will be smaller.

When the angle between $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$ is $0^\circ$:

The net force is still zero since the net force on opposite sides are zero. The net torque is also zero here; using the right hand rule, we can see that there is an outward force on each wire.
