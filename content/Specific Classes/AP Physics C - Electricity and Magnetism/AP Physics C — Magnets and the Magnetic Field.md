A Magnetic Field $B$ is the [[Force Field]] (like [[The Gravitational Field]] $G$ and [[The Electric Field]] $E$) given by a magnetic object.

The Magnetic Field points from the north pole to the south pole outside of a magnet, and south to north inside the magnet.

The variable for the magnetic field is $\vec{B}$. The units are Teslas $\mathrm{T}$, which also equal:
$$
1\mathrm{T}=\frac{N}{C\ m / s} =\frac{N}{A\ m}
$$
or Gausses which in terms of Teslas are:
$$
1\mathrm{G}=1\times 10^{-4}\mathrm{\ T}
$$

Any moving charge creates a magnetic field. Metals that have molecule dipoles aligned, are magnetic.

Charges moving through a wire induces a cylindrical magnetic field around the wire.
