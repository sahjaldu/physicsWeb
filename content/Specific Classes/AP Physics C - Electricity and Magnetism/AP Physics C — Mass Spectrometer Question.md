>[!question]- Question (a)
>In which direction, relative to the coordinate system shown, should the magnetic field point for the positive ions to move along the path shown by the dashed line in the diagram?

>[!answer]- Answer (a)
>We use the right hand rule. $\vec{F}_{B}$ points towards the center of the arc and $\vec{v}$ points downwards initially. So, $\vec{B}$ points into the page.

>[!question]- Question (b)
>Should plate K have a positive or negative voltage polarity with respect to plate L?

>[!answer]- Answer (b)
>In the initial vertical section, the velocity $\vec{v}$ is downwards and $\vec{B}$ is into the page (from the prev problem). Using right hand rule, we know that $\vec{F}_{B}$ will point to the right.

>In order to counteract that effect and keep the velocity downwards, [[The Electric Field]] needs to point to the left. Therefore, Plate $K$ should have negative voltage ($\vec{E}$ points from high to low [[Electric Potential Difference]])

>[!question]- Question (c)
>Calculate the magnitude of the electric field between the two plates.

>[!answer]- Answer (c)
>$$\begin{align}\Delta V &= - \int \vec{E} \, dr \\  1500 \mathrm{V} &= [E(r)]_{0}^{0.012} \\ 1500 &= E(0.012) \\ \Aboxed{E &= 1.25 \times 10^5 N / C} \end{align}$$

>[!question]- Question (d)
>Calculate the speed of the particle that can pass through the plates without being deflected.

>[!answer]- Answer (d)
>For the particle to remain straight, $\vec{F}_{E}=\vec{F}_{B}$. Therefore:
>$$\begin{align}\vec{F}_{E}&=\vec{F}_{B} \\q\vec{E}&=qvB \\1.25 \times 10^6 \mathrm{\,N / C}&=v(0.2 \mathrm{\,T}) \\\Aboxed{v&=6.25 \times 10^5 \mathrm{m / s}}\end{align}$$

>[!question]- Question (e)
>Calculate the mass of a hypothetically singly charged ion that travels in a semicircle of radius $R=0.5 \mathrm{\,m}$

>[!answer]- Answer (e)
>$$\begin{align}F_{B}&=ma_{c} \\&=\frac{mv^2}{r} \\m&=\frac{rF_{B}}{v^2} \\&=\frac{(0.5  \mathrm{\, m})(1.25 \times 10^5 \mathrm{\,T})}{(6.25 \times 10^5 \mathrm{\, m / s})^2} \\&=\boxed{2.56 \times 10^{-26} \mathrm{\,kg}}\end{align}$$
