This isn't to be confused with [[Electrical Potential Energy]]. Electric Potential Difference [^1] has to do with the general potential energy based on this particle on space around it.

The relationship between [[Coulomb's Law|Electric Force]] and [[Electric Field]] is the same as the relationship between [[Electrical Potential Energy]] and Potential Difference.

The equation for the electric potential is:
$$
V_{E}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \frac{q}{r}=\frac{kq}{r}
$$
We can relate to [[Electrical Potential Energy]]:
$$
\Delta U_{E}=q\Delta V
$$
And we can relate to Electric Field, just as we can relate Electric Force to Electric Potential Energy:
$$
\Delta V=-\int \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{r} 
$$
Electric Potential is measured in $\mathrm{V / C}$ (Volts per Coulombs).

[[Equipotential Lines]] show the potential difference field in a system.
