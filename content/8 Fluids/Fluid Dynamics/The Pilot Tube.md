A pilot tube is used to measure the flow speed of a gas. A gas flows with density $\rho$ and velocity $\vec{v}_{1}$ parallel to some small openings, which we name point 1.

The [[Pressure]] in the left arm of the manometer (the thin pipe), which is connected to these openings, is the [[Fluid Statics|Static]] pressure in the gas [[Streamlines and Tubes of Flow|Stream]].

At point 2, the velocity is reduced to 0 as the gas stagnates.

Applying [[Bernoulli's Equation]] to points 1 and 2, we get:
$$
p_{1}+\frac{1}{2}\rho v_{1}^2=p_{2}
$$
The manometer reads $\rho'gh$ for the difference in pressure, so we can substitute and solve for $v$, giving us:
$$
v_{1}=\sqrt{ \frac{2gh\rho'}{\rho} }
$$
