The dynamics of [[Fluids]] in motion.

We can describe the motion of a fluid by dividing the fluid into infinitely small portions, called fluid particles. Using the forces on each fluid particle, we can create equations for velocity and position. ^c18cf6

Another method is to use the density and velocity of the fluid at each point in space at a specific time, which is the method that we will use. We will describe the motion of fluids using density $\rho(x, y, z, t)$ and velocity $\vec{v}(x, y, z ,t)$.
