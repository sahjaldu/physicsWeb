[[Fluid Dynamics|Dynamic]] lift is the force that acts on a body due to its motion through a [[Fluids|Fluid]]. This is not the same as [[Buoyancy]], which uses [[Archimedes' Principle]] in [[Fluid Statics]]. For example, an airplane uses dynamic lift as it moves through the air.

Another example of lift is the flight of balls. Lets analyze how it works.

A ball that is thrown regularly with non-rotational motion has [[Streamlines and Tubes of Flow|Streamlines]] that look like such:

A ball that has has only [[Rotational Motion]] has Streamlines that look like such:

Note that without the viscosity of air, the ball would not carry air with it in such a matter. 

A ball with both linear motion and Rotational Motion has Streamlines that look like such:

The velocity of the streamlines below is less than the that above the ball. Using [[Bernoulli's Equation]], we can conclude that the pressure of the air below the ball must be greater than that above the ball, so there is a force upwards, leading to the curvature of the thrown ball.

The lift acting on an airplane wing has a similar explanation.

The streamlines above the wing are more bunched up; therefore, the air flow sleep is greater above the wing. Using Bernoulli's Equation, we conclude the pressure above is lesser, and there is a force upwards.

Another explanation is that the streamlines below hit the wing and are deflected downwards, contributing to an upwards lift.
