## Introduction

When we apply a force to a material, it will exert a reaction force according to Newton's third law.

However, depending on the application of the force and the material of the object, an object may stretch and compress appropriately before doing so. Solids can typically be in [[Static Equilibrium; Elasticity and Fracture|equilibrium]] under [[Compression]], [[Tension|Tensile]], or [[Shear|Shearing]] forces with minor changes in size or shape.

However, liquids cannot produce reaction forces to applied forces the same way. 

Most liquids are nearly incompressible, so it will provide reaction forces nearly equal to compressive forces acted on it. 

They support tensile forces to a limited extent, but not shearing forces.

Gasses do not support compressive, tensile, or shearing forces.

Liquids and gases are thus classified as fluids, which flow and fit the shape of their container.^[At large scales and with enough force, solids too act like liquids. The difference between fluids in solids is are the strength of the forces between molecules]

## Pressure:

Because [[Fluids]] do not retain a shape, they cannot sustain forces parallel to their surface. As a result, under [[Static Equilibrium; Elasticity and Fracture|static]] conditions, we only consider the force component perpendicular to the surface of the fluid.

> No matter what the shape of a fluid, forces between the interior and exterior are everywhere at right angles to the fluid boundary.

[[Pressure]] is the magnitude of this perpendicular component of force per unit surface area.

>A fluid causes an internal pressure on its surface because of the collisions between its molecules and the surface.

When a fluid is under pressure by some outside object, it will exert a reactionary force.
$$
\Delta \vec{F}=p\Delta \vec{A}
$$
Since the force $\Delta \vec{F}$ and the area element $\Delta \vec{A}$ are parallel, it can also be represented as:
$$
p=\frac{\Delta F}{\Delta A}
$$
In this situation, $\Delta A$ is small enough that our equation is independent of the size of the part we are looking at. Pressure is going to vary along the surface of the fluid.

Also, note that since $\Delta \vec{F}$ and $\Delta \vec{A}$ point in the same direction, $p$ is not a vector.
