Resistivity $\rho$ is the property of a material to restrict [[Current]]. It is not to be confused with [[Resistance]], which has to do more with how much a specific part resists current.

Some examples:
- Copper has a resistivity of $0.034 \times 10^{-5}\  \mathrm{\Omega \times cm}$.
- Iron has a resistivity of $32.54 \times 10^{-5}\ \mathrm{\Omega \times cm}$.
- Silver has a resistivity of $0.35 \times 10^{-5}\ \mathrm{\Omega \times cm}$.

The inverse of resistivity is conductivity:
$$
\sigma=\frac{1}{\rho}
$$
