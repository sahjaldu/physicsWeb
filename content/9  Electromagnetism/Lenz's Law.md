Lenz's Law gives us the direction of an induced current with the magnitude given by [[Faraday's Law]].

Induced current creates its own magnetic field, given by [[Ampereâ€™s Law]] and [[Biot-Savart Law]]. The magnetic field created opposes the change in magnetic flux, and is the reason for the negative sign in Faraday's Law.
$$
\epsilon=-\frac{d\Phi_{B}}{dt}
$$
In that way, Lenz's law is a statement of [[Conservation of Energy]].

Steps to Apply Lenz's Law:
1. Determine the direction of [[The Magnetic Field]].
2. Determine whether [[Magnetic Flux]] is increasing or decreasing.
3. If flux is increasing, induced current creates a magnetic field in the opposite direction of the current magnetic field.
4. If flux is decreasing, induced current creates a magnetic field in the same direction of the current magnetic field.

For example:

Here is a loop created by a metal bar and rod. The metal bar is moving to the right, and there is a magnetic field out of the page. What is the direction of the induced current?

>[!answer]-
>Since flux is increasing from the increasing area of the loop, there is a magnetic field created in the opposite direction of the current magnetic field. As a result, the net magnetic field out of the page decreases.

>We then use the [[Right-hand Rule for Rotation]] to determine the direction of the current. The net magnetic field is increasing downwards, so our thumb points downwards, and our fingers curl clockwise. There is a clockwise current.

Another example:
![[Pasted image 20240503103936.png]]
In this case, the bar isn't moving, but the strength of the magnetic field is decreasing. What is the direction of the induced current?

>[!answer]-
>If the strength of the magnetic field is decreasing, then flux is decreasing, meaning that there is a magnetic field created in the same direction as the current one. In other words, the magnetic field out of the page is increasing.

>Once again using the [[Right-hand Rule for Rotation]], we find that the induced current points counter-clockwise.
