Faraday's Law states that a changing [[The Magnetic Field|Magnetic Field]] through a coil of wire will "induce" a [[Current]] in the wire, called an "induced current".

The induced current is actually caused by an induced emf $\epsilon$. $I = \epsilon / R$ per [[Ohm's Law]].
$$
\epsilon = -\frac{d\Phi_{B}}{dt}
$$
The emf is generated by changing the [[Magnetic Flux]], which is done by changing the magnetic field $\vec{B}$, the area $\vec{A}$, or the angle $\theta$ between the magnetic field and the area vector.

Faraday's Law gives the magnitude of the induced emf, while [[Lenz's Law]] gives the direction.

For example:

The motional emf for the metal bar on metal rails is:
$$
\begin{align}
\epsilon&=-\frac{d\Phi_{B}}{dt} \\
&=-\frac{BdA}{dt} \\
&=-Bh \frac{dl}{dt} \\
&=\boxed{ -Bhv }
\end{align}
$$
