Equipotential Line Graphs are like a contour map, but they show potential difference rather than elevation.

- Moving a potential charge to a higher potential is like moving a mass to a high altitude. The [[Electric Potential Difference]] is like height, and the electric field is like steepness.
- Positive charges tend to accelerate towards a lower potential (like a ball rolling down a hill), and negative charges tend to accelerate towards a higher potential (like a ball with negative mass rolling up a hill lol).
- [[Electric Field]] lines (black) are always perpendicular to Equipotential Lines (gold).

We can calculate the work needed to move a charge from from one line to another:

$$
\begin{align}
U_{E}&=-W \\
W&=-U_{E} \\
W&=-q\Delta V \\
W&=-q(V_{f}-V_{0})
\end{align}
$$
