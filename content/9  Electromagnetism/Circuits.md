An electric circuit is an electrical loop that can include wires, batteries, resistors, lightbulbs, etc.

This is an example circuit with a battery, resistor, and ground. Note that the conventional [[Current]] moves from positive to negative even though electrons will move from negative to positive.

$\epsilon$ here is the Electromotive force, which represents the ideal [[Electric Potential Difference|Voltage]] across the battery terminals. ^b61b64

In the circuit above, positive charges start at the positive terminal with $\epsilon$ [[Electrical Potential Energy|Electric Energy]], then lose all of that energy as it moves across the resistor (there is a drop in voltage.) When it reaches the negative terminal of the battery, it will have 0 electric energy.

Typically, when doing circuit problems, we assume that the wire has no [[Resistance]], only counting resistance from other components. This is unless there are no other components, and we cannot assume as such.
