Electrical [[Power]] is the rate at which [[Electrical Potential Energy]] is used in a [[Circuits|Circuit]].

For example, if energy is lost through a [[Resistance|Resistor]], or a lightbulb, etc. Power is how fast energy is lost in that component.

Deriving the equation for power:
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{dq}{dt}&=I \\
dq&=I\,dt \\
q&=\int I \, dt \\
\Delta U&=q\Delta V \\
&=\int I \, dt  \\
\frac{dU}{dt}&=I\Delta V \\
\Aboxed{ P&=I\Delta V }
\end{align}
$$

We can use [[Ohm's Law]] for more variables that we can use:
$$
P=I\Delta V=I^2R=\frac{V^2}{R}
$$
