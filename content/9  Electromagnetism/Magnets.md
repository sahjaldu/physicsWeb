Magnets have two poles, a north and a south pole. When you break a magnet, that part will then gain its own north and south poles. While a magnetic monopole in theoretically possible, there is no experimental or observational evidence of it existing.

Magnetism is caused by the parallel alignment of electron [[Spin|spins]] in [[Ferromagnetic]] materials. Each electron spin causes small magnetic domains, which, after being pointed in the same direction, magnetizes the material. A material that is magnetized can align the electron spins in an unmagnetized ferromagnetic material, leading that material to be magnetized.

The Earth behaves as a large bar magnet, but the geographic North pole is the magnetic South pole.
