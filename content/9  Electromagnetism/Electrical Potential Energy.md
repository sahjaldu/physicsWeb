Some other definitions:
- The [[Energy]] stored in the [[Systems of Particles|arrangement]] of charges particles.
- The negative of the [[Work]] done by the conservative force the force of the electric field to arrange the charges.

The formula is similar to [[Coulomb's Law]], but with $r$ instead of $r^2$:
$$
U_{E}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{r}
=k\frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{r}
$$
This is also similar to the equation for [[Gravitational Potential Energy]]:
$$
U_{G}=-G \frac{m_{1}m_{2}}{r}
$$
We can relate [[Coulomb's Law|Electric Force]] to Electric Potential Energy:
$$
\Delta U_{E}=-\int \vec{F}_{E} \, d\vec{r} 
$$

>[!note]
>Potential Energy is **ALWAYS** the difference between two configurations. Sometimes you will see it as $\Delta U_{E}$ or $U_{E}$. When it doesn't have the delta, we are just assuming that one configuration is when objects are separated by infinite distance, and the potential energy is zero in that configuration.

A positive [[Potential Energy]] represents charges with a net repulsive force, and a negative potential energy represents charges with a net attractive force.

Electric Potential Energy is measured in $\mathrm{J}$ (Joules).
