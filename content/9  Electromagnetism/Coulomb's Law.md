Coulomb's Law gives the *magnitude* of the electrostatic force between two particles:
$$
\left| \vec{F}_{E} \right|=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_{0}}\left| \frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{r^2} \right|  
$$
$1/4\pi\epsilon_{0}$ can be replaced with $k$.

To find the direction of force, use the [[Fundamental Law of Charges]].

You could also use the vector version:
$$
\vec{F}_{E}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{r^2} \hat{r}
$$
It can also be in terms of [[The Electric Field]]:
$$
\vec{F}_{E}=q\vec{E}
$$
Coulomb's Law is an application of [[Gauss's Law]] for force between two particles.
