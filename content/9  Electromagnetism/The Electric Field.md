The Electric Field $\vec{E}$ is "the physical field that surrounds electrically charged particles" (Wikipedia).

[[Coulomb's Law]] describes the electric force of one electrically charge particle on another. The electric field is similar, but describes the general effect of one particle on space in general.
$$
\vec{E}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \frac{1}{r^2} \hat{r} =\frac{kq}{r^2} \hat{r}
$$
For example, by plugging in $2\mathrm{\mu C}$ for $q$ and $4\mathrm{cm}$ for $r$, we are asking: *What effect does a particle of charge $2\mathrm{\mu C}$ have $4\mathrm{cm}$ away?*

Whereas [[Coulomb's Law]] asks: *What effect does a particle of charge $2\mathrm{\mu C}$ have on another particle of charge $q_{2}$, $4\mathrm{cm}$ away?*

Another interpretation is that it is just [[Coulomb's Law]], but the charge of $q_{2}$ is $1$. 

Electric Field is in $\mathrm{C/N}$ (Coulomb's Per Newton).
