Magnetic Flux $\Phi$ is the amount of [[The Magnetic Field]] passing through an area.
$$
\Phi_{B}= \int \vec{B} \cdot \, d\vec{A} 
$$
The area [[Vectors|Vector]] is equal to $\vec{A}=({\text{Area})}(\hat{n})$ where $\hat{n}$ is the direction of the normal force. This is so that when the area is at an angle, we can show that the flux has diminished.

If the area is well defined, we can simplify the equation to:
$$
\Phi_{B} = BA\cos\theta
$$
Magnetic Flux has units of $Tm^2$
