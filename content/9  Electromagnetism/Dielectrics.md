Typically, the space between the two plates of a [[Capacitors|Capacitor]] is a vacuum. Thus, we use vacuum permittivity $\epsilon_{0}$ in our equations. 

By inserting a insulator between the plates, we can  increase the [[Capacitance]] of the Capacitor. For this new material, we use $\epsilon$ instead.

A Dielectric is the insulator used.

Say we have a parallel plate capacitor:
$$
C = \frac{\epsilon_{0}A}{d}
$$
Then, we use a dielectric:
$$
C=\frac{\epsilon A}{d}
$$
However, $\epsilon_{0}$ is still useful for manipulating this equation with other equations. So, we use a dielectric constant $\kappa$, which gives $\epsilon$ in terms of $\epsilon_{0}$.
$$
\begin{align}
\epsilon&=\kappa\epsilon_{0} \\
C&=\frac{\kappa\epsilon_{0}A}{d}
\end{align}
$$
Note that since $\kappa$ is always greater than 1, the capacitance has increased by a factor of $\kappa$.
$$
C=\kappa C_{0}
$$
Where $C_{0}$ is the old capacitance.
