Ohm's Law relates [[Electric Potential Difference]], [[Current]], and [[Resistance]] in [[Circuits]]:
$$
\Delta V=IR
$$
Ohm's law also relates Voltage, Amps, and Ohms so that:
$$
\mathrm{1 V}=\mathrm{1 A\times 1\Omega}
$$
An example of Ohm's law: For a constant voltage, if the total resistance in a circuit increases, the total current will decrease.
