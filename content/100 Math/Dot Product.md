The dot product of two [[Vectors]] is a number that tells us how much two vectors point in the same direction.

$$
\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b} = \lvert \lvert \vec{a} \rvert  \rvert \ \lvert \lvert \vec{b} \rvert  \rvert \cos (\theta)
$$

In simple terms, it is the magnitude of both vectors times the cosine of the angle between the two vectors.

When $\theta = 0$, the vectors point in the same direction. This is when the dot product is at its largest, because $\cos(0) = 1$.

When $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$, the vectors are perpendicular to each other.

When $\theta = 1$, the vectors are opposite each other. 

We usually have to compute the dot product a lot. Therefore, a shortcut is to multiply corresponding components and then add.

$$
\vec{a} = (a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3})
$$
$$
\vec{b}=(b_{1}, b_{2}, b_{3})
$$
$$
\vec{a} \cdot  \vec{b} = a_{1}b_{1} + a_{2}  b_{2} + a_{3}b_{3}
$$

This formula extends to vectors of any length.
