This is a property of a material that acts as a proportionality constant when determining elasticity.

Using an equation for change in length after a force is applied, we can use [[Stress]] and [[Strain]] to:
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{\Delta l}{l_{0}}E&=\frac{F}{A} \\
E&=\frac{F / A}{\Delta l / l_{0}} \\
E&=\frac{\mathrm{stress}}{\mathrm{strain}}
\end{align}
$$
