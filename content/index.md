# Hi There!

Welcome to PhysicsWeb, a place where I will be storing my physics notes for the public to use. This website was created using [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), which was made by [Jacky Zhao](https://jzhao.xyz/). Thanks to Atramentis and Jacky who helped me set up this site.

This website is primarily navigated through links connecting pages together. There is also a graph view in this page for an alternative view. This website is in progress, so make sure to visit in the future (and reload) for more. Have fun!

## Topics:

1. [[Systems of Particles]]
2. [[Rotational Motion]]
3. [[Static Equilibrium; Elasticity and Fracture]]
4. [[Work, Power, and Energy]]
5. [[Fluids]]
6. [[Gravitation]]

Specific Classes:
1. [[AP Physics C]]

## Prerequisites:

In order to properly use this website, you need to have to have taken an introductory physics class and know [calculus](https://wizardcalculus.netlify.app/).
## About Me:

My name is [Sahat Jaldu](https://sahatjaldu.netlify.app/), currently a high school senior. I made this website as part of my Independent Study and Mentorship class, where students choose a topic, study it, and make an impactful project with a professional in the field guiding them.

If there's any new content you want me to try and put in here, email them to `jaldu.sahat.322@gmail.com`

Physics is a topic that I am curious about, and I hope this website make you curious about it too :)
