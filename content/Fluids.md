![[Density]] is the mass per volume.

The **Specific Gravity** of a substance is defined as the ratio of the density of the substance to the density of the water.
$$
\mathrm{SG}=\frac{\rho_{a}}{\rho_{H_{2}O}}
$$

[[Pressure]] is the perpendicular force per area.

A fluid exert pressure in every direction. For a fluid at rest, the fluid pressure acts perpendicular to any solid surface that it touches.

Let's say we have a flat plane of some sort underwater. To find the force at a height $h$ below the surface of a liquid we can define the force as:
$$
F=mg=(\rho V)g=\rho Ahg
$$
Applying that to the pressure equation, $P=F / A$:
$$
\begin{align*}
P&=\frac{F}{A}=\frac{\rho Ahg}{A}\\
P&=\rho gh
\end{align*}
$$
We find that the area of the plane doesn't matter in this situation. This is because underneath a liquid, increasing the area would mean increasing the amount of space available for the liquid to press down, so the ratio of force per area stays the same.

![[Archimedes' Principle]]

Fluid flow can be either
- streamline (or laminar) — flow is smooth and regular
- turbulent flow. — flow is not smooth and regular
