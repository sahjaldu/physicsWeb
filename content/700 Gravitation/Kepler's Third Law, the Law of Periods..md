>The square of the period of any planet about the Sun is proportional to the cube of the planet's mean distance from the Sun.

Let's first prove this for circular orbits. Relating [[Newton's Law of Gravitation]] to [[Centripetal Force]]:
$$
\frac{GMm}{r^2}=m \frac{v^2}{r}
$$
Replace $v$ for $2\pi r / T$ where $T$ is the [[Rotational Motion|rotational]] period.
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{GMm}{r^2}&=m \frac{4\pi^2r^2}{r\,T^2} \\
T^2&=\left( \frac{4\pi^2}{GM} \right) r^3 \\
\end{align}
$$
When we do the same for elliptical orbits, $r$ is replaced with the semimajor axis $a$.

Note that $(4\pi^2 / GM)$ is a constant, proving Kepler's Third Law. We can also say that the ratio $T^2/a^3$ is a constant for every planet orbiting the sun.
