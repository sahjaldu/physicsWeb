>A line joining any planet to the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times.

When the planet is closer to the sun, it has greater angular velocity that when farther, resulting in the effect below.

This law is identical with the law of Conservation of [[Angular Momentum]]:
$$
\frac{ dA }{ dt } =\lim_{ \Delta t \to 0 } \frac{\Delta A}{\Delta t}=\lim_{ \Delta t \to 0 } \frac{1}{2}r^2 \frac{\Delta\theta}{\Delta t}=\frac{1}{2}r^2 \omega^2
$$
In the equation above, we analyze the areas as triangles $\frac{1}{2}bh$ or $\frac{1}{2} r\,r\Delta\theta =\frac{1}{2}r^2\Delta \theta$.

Assuming $M$ is at rest, the angular momentum of $m$ is:
$$
L_{z}=I\omega=mr^2
$$
Where the $z$ axis is perpendicular to the plane of orbit (In/Out of the screen). Therefore:
$$
\frac{ dA }{ dt } =\frac{L_{z}}{2m}
$$
Because $L_{z}$ and $m$ are constants, $\frac{ dA }{ dt }$ is also a constant, verifying Kepler's Second Law.
