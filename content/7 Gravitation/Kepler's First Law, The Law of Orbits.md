The figure above describes an object $m$ with polar coordinates $r$ and $\theta$ moving in an elliptical orbit around the larger object, the sun.

We can describe the orbit itself using the *semimajor axis* $a$, the longest radius of the ellipse, and the *eccentricity* $e$, a measure of the flatness or roundness of the ellipse (For a circle, $e=0$).

The foci of the ellipse are the larger mass $M$ and $F\,'$. $R_{a}$ is the maximum distance from $m$ to $M$ and $R_{p}$ is the shortest, $R_{a}$ is also called the aphelion and $R_{p}$ is also called the perihelion or perigee.

Note that:
$$
\begin{align}
R_{a}&=a+ea=a(1+e) \\
R_{p}&=a-ea=a(1-e)
\end{align}
$$
Most planets in the solar system have small eccentricities, so nearly circular orbits. For circular orbits, $R_{a}=R_{p}=a$.
