Escape Speed is the minimum initial speed required for an object to escape a body's gravitational field. We can find the escape speed using [[Conservation of Energy]].

Since we want the minimum speed, the final energy of our object will be 0. In other words, the object has no [[Energy]] left after escaping the field. Our final [[Kinetic Energy]] will be 0 and our final [[Potential Energy]] will be 0.

Our initial states will use the normal kinetic energy equation and [[Gravitational Potential Energy]].
$$
\frac{1}{2}mv^2+\left( \frac{-GMm}{R} \right) = 0
$$
Solving for $v$, we get:
$$
v=\sqrt{ \frac{2GM}{R} }
$$
