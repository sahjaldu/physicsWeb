Before analyzing the laws, we will assume a few things for simplicity:
1. We will only focus on the main orbiting body and the central body. For example, we may only focus on the earth and the sun, ignoring the gravitational effects other planets may have on the earth.
2. We assume the central body is so massive that we can ignore its own motion as the main orbiting body pulls on it.
