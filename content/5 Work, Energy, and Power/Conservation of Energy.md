[[Work Done on a System By External Forces]]
[[Internal Energy in A System of Particles]]

Conservation of Energy states that for a [[Systems of Particles]] with no external forces, the total energy will stay the same.
$$
\Delta K+\Delta U+\dots=\Delta E
$$
Where we add more components to the left side of the equation depending on the types of energy in the system.

Conservation of Energy is a law of nature that we have found no contradicting evidence for.
