> Heat is a means of energy transfer between a system and its environment because of the temperature difference between them.

(Physics 5th Edition by Halliday, Resnick and Krane, page 306)

We represent heat as $Q$ measured in energy units.

There are similarities between heat and [[Work]]:
1. Heat is energy in transit. We don't say that a body contains work, and we don't say that a body contains heat.
2. The amount of heat transferred depends on how the process is done.
