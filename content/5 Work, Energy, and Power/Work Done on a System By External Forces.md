For a particle within the [[Systems of Particles|System]], the [[Work]] on it would be:
$$
W_{\mathrm{net}}=W_{\mathrm{internal}}+W_{\mathrm{external}}
$$
Which, using the [[Work-Energy Theorem]]:
$$
W_{\mathrm{net}}=\Delta K
$$
Change in [[Potential Energy]] within the system can also be determined by the internal work, the work on a particle from forces within the system:
$$
\Delta U=-W_{\mathrm{internal}}
$$
We can substitute these equations to create a representation for the change in total [[Mechanical Energy]] of a system by forces outside the system:
$$
\Delta K+ \Delta U = W_{\mathrm{external}}
$$
Where the work external creates a change in [[Kinetic Energy]] and [[Potential Energy]].
