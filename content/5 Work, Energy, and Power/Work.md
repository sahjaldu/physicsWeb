Work is a force and a displacement in the direction of the force:
$$
W=\vec{F}\vec{s}
$$
Because we are using a displacement instead of distance, what matters is the end result, not the process used to get there.

We are the ones who decide the direction for work: we ask *What is the work in __ direction?*

The $\mathrm{SI}$ unit for work is the newton-meter($\mathrm{Nm}$) or the Joule $\mathrm{J}$. When dealing with subatomic particles we use the electron-volt $eV$ where $1eV=1.60\times 1^{-19}\mathrm{J}$.

For work to happen, there must be a $\vec{F}$ in the $\vec{s}$ direction or $\vec{s}$ in the $\vec{F}$ direction. When the force is opposite the direction, there is negative work.

This means we can represent work as a [[Dot Product]]:
$$
W=\vec{F}\cdot \vec{s}
$$
or:
$$
W=\vec{F}\vec{s}\cos\theta
$$
In terms of components:
$$
W=\vec{F}_{X}\Delta x+\vec{F}_{y}\Delta y
$$
We can also say that:
$$
W=\int _{i}^{f}\vec{F}\cdot \, d\vec{s} 
$$
For [[Rotational Motion]], for a rotation from $\theta_{i}$ to $\theta_{f}$, work is:
$$
\begin{align*}
dW&=(F\sin\theta)ds \\
&=(F\sin\theta)(r\ d\theta) \\
&=(rF\sin\theta)d\theta \\
W&=\int_{\theta_{i}}^{\theta_{f}}\vec{\tau} \cdot \vec{\theta} \\
\end{align*}
$$
