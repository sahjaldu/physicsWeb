Mechanical Energy is the Sum of [[Kinetic Energy]] and [[Potential Energy]]:
$$
E=K+U
$$
> It represents the total energy an object has from its motion or position

When there are no outside forces, therefore no outside [[Work]], and the system is only subject to [[Conservative Force]]s, the total mechanical energy will remain constant.
