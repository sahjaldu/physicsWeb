If we consider a rotating ridged object, such as a wheel, we can think of the wheel as consisting of many particles at various distances from the axis. Apply [[Torque]] for each particle:
$$
\Sigma \tau=(\Sigma mr^2)\alpha
$$
$\alpha$ is the same for each particle. $(\Sigma mr^2)$ is the moment of inertia, $I$.
$$
\Sigma \tau=I\alpha
$$
Which is the [[Rotational Motion]] equivalent of Newton's second law. It plays the same role that mass does for translational motion. However, Moment of Inertia takes into consideration distance $r$ from the axis.
$$
\boxed{I=\Sigma mr^2}
$$
Which also means that:
$$
I_{T}=\sum I_{N}
$$
