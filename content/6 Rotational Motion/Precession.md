According to Wikipedia:
> Precession is a change in the orientation of the rotational axis of a rotating body.

Lets use the example of a top:

The Precession Circle is the circle that the top moves around as it spins. Because of irregularities in the spin, gravity applies a torque to the top and pushes it down, causing precession.

[[Angular Momentum and Angular Velocity]]

The top rotates because of [[Torque due to Angular Momentum]].
