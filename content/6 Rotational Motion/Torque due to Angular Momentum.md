[[Angular Momentum and Angular Velocity]]
[[Torque]]

We can split a tops angular momentum $\vec{L}$ into two parts, $l_{z}$ and $l_{\perp}$. As the top spins, $l_{z}$ will remain constantly upwards but $l_{\perp}$ will be constantly changing direction. Going back to our full picture of momentum, this means $\vec{L}$ has a constant $d\vec{l}$. We know that:
$$
\frac{d\vec{l}}{dt}=\vec{\tau}
$$
So a constant torque forms along the top. This can also be thought of as the torque that changes the direction of $\vec{L}$.
