Why do we use the [[Right-hand Rule]]?

When we look at something spinning, the direction in which it spins differs based on perspective. What might look counter-clockwise to me may look clockwise to a person on the other side of the object.

Try this out with any spinning object and see how the direction changes depending on which side you look at it.

Using the Right hand rule, we can specify a direction that does not change due to perspective. Once again, look at a spinning object and use right-hand rule for the front and back. You will see how our thumb points to the same direction for both sides, so we have a specifies direction for our rotation.
