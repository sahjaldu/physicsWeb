A spinning object has a centripetal acceleration towards its axis.

Acceleration is defined by:
$$
\vec{a}=\frac{\vec{v}_{2}-\vec{v_{1}}}{\Delta t}=\frac{\Delta \vec{v}}{t}
$$
However, our velocity doesn't only change by magnitude, but also by direction.

Let's assume we have an acceleration of constant magnitude. By taking a very small change in $l$ along the circumference over a very small $\Delta t$, we get:

Our $\Delta \vec{v}$ is the difference between these two velocities, so:

As $\Delta\theta$ becomes increasingly smaller, $\vec{v}_{1}$ will become almost parallel to $\vec{v}_{2}$ and $\Delta \vec{v}$ will point towards the center of the circle. As a result, $\vec{a}$ will also point towards the center of the circle.

Since we are only focusing on direction and not magnitude, we will have it be different from normal angular acceleration and call it centripetal acceleration $\vec{a}_{R}$.

We can calculate the magnitude of centripetal acceleration. Take $\Delta\theta$ and $\Delta t$ to be extremely small and $v=v_{1}=v_{2}$ since the magnitude does not change (note that $v$ does not have an arrowâ€”this is a magnitude), we can write:
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\Delta v}{v}&\approx \frac{\Delta l}{r} \\
\Delta v&=\frac{v}{r}\Delta l \\
 \\
a_{r}&=\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}=\frac{v}{r} \frac{\Delta l}{\Delta t}=\frac{v}{r}v \\ \\
a_{r}&=\frac{v^2}{r} \\
\end{align*}
$$
Using centripetal acceleration, we can get a [[Centripetal Force]].
